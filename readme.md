A Predictable State Management 👀.

💩 Using old redux getState function return a reference to the local state instead of create a clone of that, can easily mutated this may not predictable anymore.

👎 Install both (react-redux, redux) packages may not not necessary.

👎 Too much middlewares installed in your project.

👍 Improve create your custom middleware with ease.
